<p>This website is dedicated to depression and anxiety peer support. The main forms of communication we offer are via our supportive Depression Chat Rooms, Depression Forums and our Depression Blog section.</p>

<p>Whilst our primary objective is to connect people that have issues regarding depression and anxiety, we also warmly welcome others that may have health issues that are related to depression and anxiety. For example: bipolar disorder, eating disorders, obsessive compulsive disorder and so forth. In addition to this, we also actively encourage those that live with, or care for someone with depression and/or anxiety to partake in this community in order that they learn more about these health concerns.</p>

<p>This website is independent, non profit making and is free for all to use. We would however like to express our gratitude to  Depression Understood for the kind use of some of their resources. Please note that you may be connected to our sister website when accessing some of the options that we offer. This is primarily to aid the cause of mutual depression support throughout the Internet.</p>
